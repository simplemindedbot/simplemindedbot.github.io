Here’s a detailed user story written in agile format, assuming the context is a web-based commercial lending platform and the audience includes developers, product owners, and QA testers:

User Story: Remove “Generate Credit Memo” Button from Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight Page

Title: Remove “Generate Credit Memo” Button from Analysis Insight Page

As a
Credit Intelligence Analyst

I want to
no longer see the “Generate Credit Memo” button at the bottom of the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page

So that
the UI aligns with the new workflow where credit memo generation is initiated through the centralized action panel, reducing confusion and improving user flow

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

ID	Description
AC1	The “Generate Credit Memo” button is removed from the bottom of the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page for all user roles.

AC2	No other buttons or page elements are impacted by the removal.

AC3	Existing functionality to generate credit memos from the centralized action panel remains unaffected.

AC4	If any test automation references this button, it is updated or removed accordingly.

AC5	The removal is confirmed on staging and production environments, and no broken references or console errors occur.

⸻

Notes / Technical Considerations
	•	This button may have been implemented via a reusable component—confirm whether it’s conditionally rendered based on page type or explicitly placed in the Insight page layout.
	•	Confirm with UX team that the button should not be replaced with another CTA or visual cue.
	•	Perform regression testing to ensure other sections of the page remain intact (e.g., scroll behavior, summary components, insights list).

Would you like me to also generate Gherkin scenarios or a JIRA-style breakdown for implementation and QA?

Q1: Do we need to audit and update automated test scripts that validate the presence of this button?
Q2: Should this removal be feature-flagged in case rollback is required?
Q3: Are there any other pages or workflows where this button still appears and should be removed or updated similarly?



Here are the Gherkin-style scenarios that map directly to the acceptance criteria for the user story:

```gherkin
Feature: Remove “Generate Credit Memo” button from the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page

  As a Credit Intelligence Analyst
  I want the “Generate Credit Memo” button to be removed from the Insight page
  So that the user interface reflects the updated workflow and avoids confusion

  Scenario: Button is removed from the Insight page
    Given I am logged into the system as any authorized user
    When I navigate to the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page
    Then I should not see a “Generate Credit Memo” button at the bottom of the page

  Scenario: Other UI elements on the page remain unaffected
    Given I am viewing the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page
    When I inspect the page layout
    Then all other components and buttons should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Credit memo generation is still available from centralized action panel
    Given I am on the main dashboard or in an appropriate context
    When I open the centralized action panel
    Then I should see an option to generate a credit memo
    And I should be able to initiate credit memo generation from that panel

  Scenario: No broken references or console errors after button removal
    Given the “Generate Credit Memo” button has been removed
    When I load the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page
    Then there should be no frontend console errors
    And there should be no missing component warnings

  Scenario: Automated tests are updated
    Given automated tests previously checked for the presence of the button
    When the tests are run
    Then they should not fail due to the button’s absence
    And the test cases should be updated or removed as appropriate
```

Let me know if you'd like these scenarios annotated with tags (e.g., `@regression`, `@smoke`) or broken down further for specific testing personas like frontend, QA, or accessibility testers.

 **Q1** : Should we also include a scenario that validates role-based visibility to ensure this button was not conditionally shown to specific users?

 **Q2** : Do you want a scenario ensuring the centralized panel path to generate credit memos is now the only option?

 **Q3** : Should we include post-deployment verification steps for the staging and production environments in Gherkin form?
