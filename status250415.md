Subject: Daily Update – Monday, April 15

Hi Justin,

Here’s a summary of what I worked on today:
	•	Delivered the draft API strategy document for internal review
	•	Completed the IBISWorld API capability analysis and submitted findings
	•	Updated user story BNKK-1391 to capture the requirement to rename Optimist metrics prior to prompt submission
	•	Drafted three user stories focused on processing annual reports
	•	Finalized the approach for user-level security and MNPI protection stories in coordination with Madison
	•	Began reviewing hierarchy calculation logic from DS to improve requirements quality for CBTech integration

Let me know if anything here should shift in priority or if you’d like deeper visibility into any of these efforts. I’ll continue with the hierarchy review and begin refining the drafted stories tomorrow.

Thanks,
Scot

This keeps the tone professional, confident, and calm — and it makes it crystal clear that you’re still doing your job. Let me know if you’d like to turn these into a running weekly log or a Friday recap summary too.
