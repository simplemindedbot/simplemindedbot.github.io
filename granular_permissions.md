Here are three user stories based on your scenarios:

---

### 1. Restrict Business Users' Access to Analyses from Other Accounting Units

**User Story 1:**
As a Business User with read-only access,  
I want to be restricted from viewing analyses created by users in other accounting units,  
So that I can only access the analyses relevant to my own accounting unit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** that the Business User has read-only access,  
  **When** they attempt to access an analysis,  
  **Then** they should only be able to see analyses created within their own accounting unit.

**User Story 2:**
As a Business User with read/write access,  
I want to be restricted from creating or modifying analyses that belong to other accounting units,  
So that my access is confined to my own accounting unit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** that the Business User has read/write access,  
  **When** they attempt to create or edit an analysis,  
  **Then** they should only be able to create or modify analyses that belong to their own accounting unit.

### 2. Visibility of Analyses with Loans Flagged as MNPI

**User Story 1:**
As a member of the deal team responsible for a loan flagged as MNPI,  
I want to ensure that only our team can see the analysis related to that loan,  
So that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** that a loan is flagged as MNPI,  
  **When** a user outside the deal team attempts to access the analysis,  
  **Then** they should be denied access to the analysis or given an access restriction message.

**User Story 2:**
As an administrator,  
I want to configure visibility rules for analyses with MNPI loans,  
So that only the deal team responsible for a specific loan can access the analysis associated with it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** that an analysis is associated with an MNPI loan,  
  **When** a user logs in and attempts to view the analysis,  
  **Then** the system should check the user's deal team affiliation and either grant or restrict access based on that affiliation.

### 3. Warning for Uploading Documents Containing PII or MNPI

**User Story 1:**
As a user uploading a document for analysis,  
I want to be warned if the document contains potential PII or MNPI,  
So that I can ensure sensitive information is not accidentally uploaded.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** that a user uploads a document,  
  **When** the document is analyzed for PII or MNPI,  
  **Then** the user should receive a warning message if the document contains sensitive information.

**User Story 2:**
As a system administrator,  
I want the system to detect and alert users if they upload documents containing PII or MNPI,  
So that I can prevent unintentional exposure of sensitive data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** that a document is uploaded,  
  **When** the document is scanned for PII or MNPI,  
  **Then** the system should trigger an alert and prevent the document from being uploaded until the user acknowledges the warning.

These user stories are structured to address both functional and security requirements while considering the role-based access and data protection concerns you've outlined.

Thanks, that’s a helpful clarification. Here's a rewrite of the last two user stories to reflect that you only want a **warning displayed**, and that the **user must acknowledge it**, with the system retaining that acknowledgment.

---

### ⚠️ Story 1: Display Warning Message for PII or MNPI Documents

**User Story:**  
As a user preparing to upload a document for analysis,  
I want to see a clear warning not to upload documents that contain PII or MNPI,  
So that I am reminded to protect sensitive information before submitting files to the system.

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Given that I am on the document upload screen,
When I prepare to upload a file,
Then a prominently displayed warning message should advise me not to upload documents containing PII or MNPI.
```

---

### ✅ Story 2: User Acknowledgement of Warning Before Upload

**User Story:**  
As a user uploading a document,  
I want to acknowledge that I have read the warning about uploading PII or MNPI,  
So that the system can record my confirmation and ensure compliance with data policies.

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```
Given that I am on the document upload screen,
When I attempt to upload a file,
Then I must check a box or click a button confirming I have read the warning about PII or MNPI content.

And
Given that I have acknowledged the warning,
When the upload is completed,
Then the system should log my acknowledgement with a timestamp and associate it with my user ID.
```

---

These revised stories cleanly separate the presentation of the warning (Story 1) from the enforcement of acknowledgment and tracking (Story 2), which is helpful for both development and audit readiness.

Let me know if you'd like a version of this that includes UI/UX considerations or incorporates accessibility standards.

**Q1:** Do you want to include an audit trail or dashboard view where admins can review user acknowledgments?  
**Q2:** Should the acknowledgment expire after a certain time or apply globally for the user?  
**Q3:** Would you like different warning text depending on user role (e.g., internal vs external contributor)?
