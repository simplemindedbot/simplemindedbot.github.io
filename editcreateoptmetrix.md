Here is a breakdown of the feature into eight user stories with clearly defined scopes, focused responsibilities, and roles aligned to the entitlement model. These stories follow the INVEST principle (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).

Let me know if you’d like accompanying Gherkin scenarios, wireframe ideas, or a sequence diagram for any of these stories.

Q1: Would you like Gherkin-style acceptance criteria for each story for inclusion in a BRD or Jira?
Q2: Should the centralized location support bulk edits or CSV import/export in future phases?
Q3: Do you want a permission matrix table to go along with this for easy stakeholder reference?

Here are Gherkin-formatted acceptance criteria for each of the 8 user stories related to the centralized Optimist metrics dashboard:

Let me know if you’d like these organized into a Jira export, BRD appendix, or accompanied by mock UI annotations.

Q1: Should we include validation scenarios for each field (e.g. required, data type, limits)?
Q2: Do you want to add bulk upload or batch update as a future enhancement?
Q3: Should the audit log be visible via UI, or just stored in the backend?
