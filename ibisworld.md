Authentication:

The API employs token-based authentication to ensure secure data access. Users need to obtain an access token by providing their API credentials, which must be included in the header of each API request.

Endpoints and Data Retrieval:

IBISWorld’s API is structured to offer both full report access and granular data retrieval. Users can request entire Industry or Procurement reports or focus on specific sections. For example, to obtain the full industry report, the endpoint would be: ￼

https://api.ibisworld.com/industry/v3/fullreport

Detailed information on all available endpoints, including their structures and parameters, is provided in the API’s Data Dictionary. This resource outlines string values for sections, data types, and descriptions for all returned classes and fields, aiding developers in seamless integration.

Request Limits and Data Size:

The API enforces specific rate limits to ensure optimal performance:
	•	10 calls per second ￼
	•	100 calls per minute ￼
	•	5,000 calls per hour ￼

While caching of results is permitted, frequent refreshes are recommended due to regular report updates. To assist with this, the “UpdatedReports” endpoint provides a list of all reports updated within specified date ranges. ￼

Regarding data size, the initial download for all combined Industry reports is approximately 1.5GB, and all Risk reports total about 0.4GB. A single Industry report can be up to 700KB when retrieved via the full report API. ￼

Versioning:

The API is currently on version 3 (v3), with a sequential numbering system reflecting the order of releases. Minor updates increment the version by 0.1, while major releases advance to the next whole number. Including the version in the endpoint URL is mandatory to ensure compatibility and access to the correct functionalities. For instance: ￼

https://api.ibisworld.com/industry/v3/fullreport

IBISWorld continues to support previous API versions to ensure ongoing functionality for clients who have built applications using earlier versions. However, migrating to newer versions is encouraged to access the latest features and improvements. ￼

In summary, IBISWorld’s API offers a robust and flexible solution for integrating comprehensive industry research into various enterprise systems, thereby enhancing efficiency and supporting data-driven decision-making. ￼

This targeted approach enables organizations to integrate precise information into their systems, enhancing various business functions.

  

Granular Data Retrieval:

  

Instead of downloading entire reports, users can request individual sections or specific data points. The API's Data Dictionary provides comprehensive details on all string values for sections that can be used as body parameters, along with data types and descriptions for all returned classes and fields.

  

Practical Applications:

1. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems: Sales teams can enrich CRM platforms with up-to-date industry insights, enabling personalized interactions with clients and prospects.

2. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems: Integrating specific industry data into ERP systems aids in strategic planning and resource allocation by providing insights into market trends and financial benchmarks.

3. Credit Risk Assessment: Financial institutions can incorporate industry risk ratings and financial ratios into their credit risk models, improving the accuracy of loan assessments.

4. Market Analysis Tools: Marketing teams can access detailed industry segmentation data to identify target markets and tailor strategies accordingly.

  

Implementation Considerations:

- Authentication: Secure access is maintained through token-based authentication, requiring valid API credentials for each request.
- Rate Limits: The API enforces limits of 10 calls per second, 100 calls per minute, and 5,000 calls per hour to ensure optimal performance.
- Data Updates: Regular updates to reports necessitate frequent data refreshes. The "UpdatedReports" endpoint assists in identifying recently modified reports.

  

By leveraging granular data retrieval through IBISWorld's API, organizations can enhance decision-making processes, streamline operations, and maintain a competitive edge in their respective industries.

IBISWorld's API allows for granular data retrieval, enabling users to access specific sections of industry and procurement reports rather than downloading entire documents. This targeted approach facilitates efficient data integration into various applications and systems.
