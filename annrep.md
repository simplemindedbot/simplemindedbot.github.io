Here’s the updated user story that combines the first two into a single, coherent story, with the logic for determining annual vs. non-annual based on the upload location:

⸻

Determine Report Type Based on File Upload Location

Description:
As a data science engineer, I want to determine whether the uploaded file contains annual or non-annual data based on its upload location so that the ingestion process can apply the correct processing rules and downstream models can interpret the data accordingly.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):
	•	GIVEN a file is uploaded to a designated upload location
WHEN the ingestion process begins
THEN the system should infer the report type (annual or non-annual) based solely on the configured upload location associated with that file path
	•	GIVEN a file is uploaded to an undefined or misconfigured location
WHEN the ingestion process begins
THEN the system should raise an alert or error indicating the report type cannot be determined
	•	GIVEN the report type has been determined via upload location
WHEN the file is ingested
THEN the determined type should be logged and tagged as metadata with the file in the data store

⸻

Let me know if you’d like to include fallbacks or override mechanisms (e.g., user-specified metadata), or if this should be expanded to support future sources beyond file uploads.

Q1: Should this logic support overrides if the file includes internal markers that contradict the upload location?
Q2: Do you want a story covering how these locations are maintained and mapped in the system config?
Q3: Would you like to define and document the accepted upload locations and their associated report types?

Thanks, that helps clarify the intent. Here’s a revised version of the third user story, now focused specifically on generating the file for delivery to the LLM, using section headers to distinguish between content types:

Generate Single Structured File for LLM Ingestion

Description:
As a credit technology engineer, I want to generate a single structured file for delivery to the LLM, using section headers to separate distinct content areas within the document, so that the LLM can accurately parse and analyze multiple types of data from a unified source.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):
	•	GIVEN one or more document inputs are uploaded (e.g., annual statement, YTD statement, footnotes)
WHEN the ingestion system processes these inputs
THEN a single consolidated file should be created for delivery to the LLM
	•	GIVEN distinct document types (e.g., annual data, YTD data, footnotes)
WHEN the consolidated file is generated
THEN each content section must begin with a clearly labeled section header (e.g., ## Annual Statement, ## YTD Statement, ## Footnotes) that persists through delivery
	•	GIVEN the file has been structured with section headers
WHEN it is passed to the LLM
THEN the structure must be preserved in a machine-readable format (e.g., Markdown, JSON with section keys) that supports accurate parsing by the model
	•	GIVEN malformed or ambiguous inputs
WHEN the file generation process is triggered
THEN the system should log a warning and continue only with valid sections, or halt with an error based on severity thresholds

⸻

Let me know if you’d like to specify the file format (e.g., .md, .json, .txt) or describe what a valid section header should contain (e.g., metadata, date, report type).

Q1: Should this story include LLM-specific constraints such as max token limits or formatting guidance?
Q2: Do you want the system to insert metadata (e.g., source file name, upload date) into the structured file?
Q3: Should there be a verification step to validate that all expected sections are included before delivery to the LLM?

Here’s a combined version of stories 5 and 6, which now describe how footnotes are associated with the correct reporting period using the date on the first page of the uploaded document:

Associate Annual Footnotes with Correct Optimist Statement Using Document Date

Description:
As a data science and CBTech engineer, I want to use the date on the first page of an uploaded file to associate annual footnotes with the most recent annual Optimist statement, so that the ingestion process accurately maps narrative commentary to the correct financial period.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):
	•	GIVEN a file containing annual footnotes is uploaded
WHEN the ingestion process begins
THEN the system should extract the date from the first page of the document
	•	GIVEN the extracted first-page date
WHEN compared to available Optimist statements
THEN the system should associate the footnotes with the most recent annual Optimist statement that matches the reporting period indicated by the date
	•	GIVEN the footnotes do not clearly align with an annual Optimist statement
WHEN no match is found
THEN the system should log the mismatch and flag the file for manual review
	•	GIVEN successful association of footnotes and Optimist data
WHEN the LLM input is generated
THEN the footnotes should be included under a clearly labeled section header referencing the appropriate financial period

⸻

Let me know if you want to define how close the dates must be to constitute a “match” (e.g., same fiscal year, within 30 days), or if we should create fallback rules when dates are missing or ambiguous.

Q1: Should the system prioritize matching based on fiscal year, calendar year, or a configurable threshold?
Q2: Do we need to support edge cases like amended footnotes or supplemental disclosures issued after the original statement?
Q3: Should a confidence score be calculated and stored for each footnote-to-statement match?
