To extract the necessary source database, table, and column information from the ART team using the JSON they produced, you should ask focused and structured questions that guide them to confirm and clarify their mappings. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to ask and why:

⸻

1. Request the JSON Mapping Document and Its Metadata

Start by ensuring you’re working with the latest and complete mapping file.

Ask:
	•	“Can you provide the latest version of the JSON mapping that includes field-level lineage from ART to the source systems?”
	•	“Does the JSON include metadata for each field such as source database, table name, and column name?”

⸻

2. Clarify the Level of Lineage Provided

You need to know if their mapping includes full lineage (database > schema > table > column) and whether it’s always available for every field.

Ask:
	•	“For each data element collected by ART, does the mapping include:
	•	The source database name?
	•	The schema and table name?
	•	The exact column name?”
	•	“Are there any fields that are derived, calculated, or mapped through a transformation layer (e.g., staging tables, views)? If so, can you indicate those clearly?”

⸻

3. Understand the Structure of the JSON File

You may need to parse or extract the information programmatically, so you want to know the structure.

Ask:
	•	“Can you provide a schema or description of the JSON structure—specifically how the fields, tables, and databases are represented?”
	•	“Is there a one-to-one mapping between ART fields and source columns, or are there many-to-one or one-to-many relationships?”

⸻

4. Ask for Clarification on Ambiguities or Gaps

Many mappings have missing or ambiguous fields. You want to address those early.

Ask:
	•	“Which fields in the JSON are missing full source lineage (e.g., only table name but no database, or alias names instead of true column names)?”
	•	“If any source system names are abbreviated or obfuscated, can you provide a glossary or mapping for those?”

⸻

5. Request Enrichment or Help Interpreting the JSON

If the JSON is large or poorly documented, you may need their help converting it into a usable format.

Ask:
	•	“Would it be possible to get a flattened Excel/CSV export of the mapping in the format: ART Field Name | Source DB | Source Schema | Source Table | Source Column?”
	•	“Could you provide a sample mapping for 3–5 commonly used ART fields, annotated to show the full lineage?”

⸻

6. Confirm Synchronization with Data Governance or Metadata Repositories

In case there’s a canonical metadata source, check for alignment.

Ask:
	•	“Is the source mapping aligned with the enterprise data catalog or any governed metadata repository?”
	•	“Do you have lineage diagrams or Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) for the source systems referenced in the JSON?”

⸻

Template You Can Send the ART Team

Here’s a message you can adapt:

⸻

Hi [ART Contact Name],

I’m reviewing the JSON mapping produced by the ART team and trying to extract the source lineage for each field. To make sure we’re aligned, can you please confirm the following:
	1.	Does each field in the JSON include:
	•	Source database name
	•	Schema and table name
	•	Actual column name?
	2.	Are there any derived or transformed fields? If so, how are those transformations documented?
	3.	Could you share a brief description or schema of the JSON format so I can parse it accurately?
	4.	For any fields with ambiguous or missing lineage, is there a glossary or mapping reference?
	5.	If available, can you also provide a flattened version (CSV or Excel) of the field-level mapping showing:
ART Field | Source DB | Source Schema | Source Table | Source Column

This would really help accelerate our integration and validation efforts.

Thanks!

Let me know if you’d like help writing a parser for the JSON file or generating a table of mappings from it.

Q2: How can I automate extraction of table/column names from a complex nested JSON file?
Q3: What tools exist for visualizing database lineage from JSON mapping files like these?
