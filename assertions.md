Here’s a breakdown of user stories that naturally emerge from the feature description you provided. These are grouped by functionality and actor, assuming standard agile story formatting (As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]) and aligned with the flow of the system:

⸻

1. Narrative Accuracy Review & Validation

US-001: Initial Narrative Accuracy Review
As a reviewer, I want to compare AI-generated narrative data with Optimist source data across metric value, directional change, and $ value delta so that I can validate narrative accuracy.

US-002: Calculate Final Narrative Accuracy Score
As the system, I want to calculate an overall percentage accuracy score for each AI-generated narrative so that I can determine if the narrative meets the threshold for acceptance.

US-003: Mark Metrics Below 100% Accuracy
As a reviewer, I want the system to identify and highlight any individual metrics that do not achieve 100% accuracy so that I can focus manual review where it is needed.

⸻

2. Narrative Approval & Reprocessing Logic

US-004: Approve Narrative for UI Landing
As the system, I want to render the narrative to the Analysis Insights UI if the final accuracy score is acceptable so that the UW can consume a verified output.

US-005: Re-run AI Narrative on Failure
As the system, I want to reprocess the narrative with the AI model if the accuracy score is not acceptable so that I can generate a better result.

US-006: Halt Processing on Repeated Failures
As the system, I want to halt further analysis if multiple re-runs still result in failed accuracy scores so that the user is not presented with unreliable insights.

⸻

3. UI Status Updates and User Feedback

US-007: Reflect Failed Analysis on Analysis List Page
As a user, I want the failed status to be reflected in the New and Existing Analyses UI so that I know which transactions could not be analyzed successfully.

US-008: Remove Pending Banner for Failed Analysis
As a user, I want the pending analysis banner removed when the transaction fails so that the UI reflects the correct processing state.

US-009: Prevent UI Launch for Failed Analysis
As a user, I want to be prevented from launching the Analysis Insights UI for transactions with failed analysis so that I don’t waste time on incomplete results.

⸻

4. Notifications & Messaging

US-010: Notify User of Failed Transaction via Email
As the system, I want to notify the user via email if their analysis fails so that they’re aware and can take action or follow up.

US-011: Notify User of Analysis Accuracy and Status
As a user, I want to see a summary notification when the narrative is ready that includes the accuracy score and validation instructions so that I can review the results quickly.

US-012: Display Detailed Accuracy Breakdown Inline
As a user, I want to view accuracy breakdowns (per statement/metric) directly within the narrative editing UI so that I don’t have to switch contexts to make corrections.

US-013: Dismiss or Minimize Notification Panel
As a user, I want the ability to close or minimize the accuracy notification panel so that I can focus on the narrative editing without distraction.

US-014: Notify UW of Analysis Delay (Interim Alert)
As the system, I want to send a delay notification to the UW if the analysis is taking longer than expected so that they are aware that it is still in process.

⸻

5. Logging and Auditing

US-015: Log Accuracy Results for Audit
As the system, I want to store all narrative accuracy scores, failed attempts, and review results so that I can support future audits or compliance reviews.

⸻

Optional Enhancements or Epics to Consider:
	•	Epic: Narrative Review Dashboard
Enable reviewers to see status and accuracy scores across multiple narratives in a single view.
	•	Epic: Reviewer Workflow Support
Add UI support for tagging narrative issues, commenting inline, or requesting specific AI corrections.
	•	Epic: AI Retry Governance
Add rules or thresholds for how many retries are allowed and who can override failure states.

⸻

Would you like these stories grouped into epics or prioritized using something like MoSCoW or WSJF?

Q1: Who performs the narrative review—internal users or an automated validator?
Q2: Is the accuracy threshold static, or does it vary by business unit or product type?
Q3: Should the AI retry logic be tunable (e.g., max retries, time delay between retries)?
