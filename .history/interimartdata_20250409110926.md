To facilitate integration between the Credit Intelligence application and the ART (Automated Risk Tool) risk assessment platform, we will establish an interim data sourcing strategy. While the ART team continues development and finalization of their public API, our application will directly access ART-related data stored in the WDM (Warehouse Data Mart). This approach will allow us to align and match required data elements based on the ART user interface (UI) specifications.

By leveraging WDM as a temporary data source, we ensure continuity in integration development, enable early validation of data mappings, and mitigate dependency risks associated with the delayed API availability. Once the ART API becomes available, we will deprecate the WDM dependency in favor of the standardized integration endpoint.
