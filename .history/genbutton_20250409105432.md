Here’s a detailed user story written in agile format, assuming the context is a web-based commercial lending platform and the audience includes developers, product owners, and QA testers:

User Story: Remove “Generate Credit Memo” Button from Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight Page

Title: Remove “Generate Credit Memo” Button from Analysis Insight Page

As a
Credit Intelligence Analyst

I want to
no longer see the “Generate Credit Memo” button at the bottom of the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page

So that
the UI aligns with the new workflow where credit memo generation is initiated through the centralized action panel, reducing confusion and improving user flow

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

ID	Description
AC1	The “Generate Credit Memo” button is removed from the bottom of the Credit Intelligence Analysis Insight page for all user roles.

AC2	No other buttons or page elements are impacted by the removal.

AC3	Existing functionality to generate credit memos from the centralized action panel remains unaffected.

AC4	If any test automation references this button, it is updated or removed accordingly.

AC5	The removal is confirmed on staging and production environments, and no broken references or console errors occur.

⸻

Notes / Technical Considerations
	•	This button may have been implemented via a reusable component—confirm whether it’s conditionally rendered based on page type or explicitly placed in the Insight page layout.
	•	Confirm with UX team that the button should not be replaced with another CTA or visual cue.
	•	Perform regression testing to ensure other sections of the page remain intact (e.g., scroll behavior, summary components, insights list).

Would you like me to also generate Gherkin scenarios or a JIRA-style breakdown for implementation and QA?

Q1: Do we need to audit and update automated test scripts that validate the presence of this button?
Q2: Should this removal be feature-flagged in case rollback is required?
Q3: Are there any other pages or workflows where this button still appears and should be removed or updated similarly?
