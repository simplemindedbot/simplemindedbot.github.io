Absolutely. Here is a **user story** crafted from the **business goals** you defined, staying grounded in **product management language** but now expressed using the user story format commonly used in agile environments (e.g., with Acceptance Criteria). This bridges strategic intent with actionable delivery.

## ✅ **User Story: Hierarchical Precalculation for Financial Insight Clarity**

**Title:** Introduce Hierarchical Precalculation Structure to Improve Insight Clarity and Model Guidance

**As** a Credit Intelligence product manager,

**I want** financial metrics in our pipeline to follow a clear hierarchical structure—separating raw inputs, intermediate calculations, and final insights—

**So that** our generative model can produce clearer, more accurate narratives, and our analysts can trace insights back to source data with confidence.

## 📘 **Example Usage Scenario**

> When generating a credit intelligence prompt, the system now pulls the `derived_insights.financing_position` value of `"Requirement"` and uses the `narrative_summary` field to construct a natural language explanation.
>
> If needed, an analyst can trace that result to `intermediate_metrics.total_external_financing` and further to `raw_inputs.change_in_loans_related`.

## 🛠 Supporting Notes

* This story **does not introduce productization** (e.g., module registration or plug-ins).
* It focuses solely on **cleanly structured, hierarchical logic** that improves:
  * Model guidance
  * Analyst trust
  * Maintenance and testability of financial logic
