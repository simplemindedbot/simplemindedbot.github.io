IBISWorld’s API allows for granular data retrieval, enabling users to access specific sections of industry and procurement reports rather than downloading entire documents. This targeted approach facilitates efficient data integration into various applications and systems.

**Available Data Sections:**

The API provides access to a variety of report sections, including but not limited to:

* **Industry Overview:** General information about the industry, its definition, and primary activities.
* **Market Characteristics:** Details on market size, segmentation, and customer demographics.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Information on major players, market shares, and competitive dynamics.
* **Financial Performance:** Key financial metrics and benchmarks within the industry.
* **Risk Ratings:** Assessments of potential risks and challenges faced by the industry.

For a comprehensive list of all available sections and their corresponding identifiers, users should refer to the API’s Data Dictionary. This resource provides detailed information on string values for sections, data types, and descriptions of all returned classes and fields.**  **

**Utilizing Granular Data Retrieval:**

To retrieve specific sections, users need to include the desired section identifiers in their API requests. This approach allows for the extraction of only pertinent data, optimizing bandwidth and processing efficiency.

**Implementation Considerations:**

* **Authentication:** Access requires a valid IBISWorld account with API permissions. Authentication is managed via OAuth 2.0 protocol.**  **
* **Request Limits:** The API enforces limits of 10 calls per second, 100 calls per minute, and 5,000 calls per hour.**  **
* **Data Updates:** Reports are updated regularly. The “UpdatedReports” endpoint can be used to identify recently modified reports.**  **

By leveraging granular data retrieval, organizations can seamlessly integrate precise industry insights into their systems, enhancing decision-making processes and operational efficiency.
