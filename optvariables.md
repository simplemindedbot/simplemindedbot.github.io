Here’s a breakdown of the user stories that cover the described functionality. I’ve broken it into two parts for clarity: one for adding fields from Optimist via a UI and another for allowing users to create new values using logical and mathematical operators.

### **User Story 1: Ability to Add Optimist Fields in the Admin Dashboard**

**Title:** As an administrative user, I want the ability to add additional Optimist fields into the prompt input for analysis via a user-friendly UI on the Admin Dashboard, so that I can extend the data used in analysis.

**Description:**
- As an admin, I need an interface on the Admin Dashboard that allows me to select and add existing fields from the Optimist system into the analysis prompt.
- The UI should display a list of available Optimist fields that I can choose from.
- The system should allow the addition of multiple fields at once, with each field appearing as a selectable option in the list.
- The admin should be able to view and remove any fields added to the prompt input dynamically.
- The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with tooltips or guidance for field selection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** I am logged in as an administrative user,
  **When** I navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the option to add Optimist fields to the analysis prompt,
  **Then** I should see a list of available Optimist fields.
- **Given** I select one or more Optimist fields from the list,
  **When** I click the 'Add' button,
  **Then** the selected fields should appear in the analysis prompt input as part of the configuration.
- **Given** I have added fields to the prompt input,
  **When** I click the 'Remove' button next to any field,
  **Then** the field should be removed from the prompt input.
- **Given** I am in the UI to add fields,
  **When** I interact with the field selection list,
  **Then** I should be able to filter fields by name or category (if applicable).

### **User Story 2: Ability to Create New Values by Combining Fields with Operators**

**Title:** As an administrative user, I want the ability to create new values by combining Optimist fields with standard conditional and mathematical operators in the Admin Dashboard UI, so that I can define custom logic for data analysis.

**Description:**
- As an admin, I want to be able to create custom values by combining Optimist fields with standard operators such as if/then, and/or, and mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) to form more complex values that can be used in the analysis prompt.
- The UI should allow me to drag and drop fields into a logic or math expression editor.
- I should be able to apply logical operations (e.g., if/then) and mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) to the fields.
- The system should allow the creation of composite expressions with multiple operators and fields.
- The UI should validate that the syntax is correct, and provide error messages if any part of the expression is invalid.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** I am logged in as an administrative user,
  **When** I navigate to the field creation section of the Admin Dashboard and select the option to combine fields with operators,
  **Then** I should see a simple, intuitive interface to build custom expressions using fields from Optimist.
- **Given** I select a field and a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /),
  **When** I click on another field and apply the selected operator,
  **Then** I should see the resulting formula with the fields and operators.
- **Given** I use a conditional operator (e.g., if/then, and/or),
  **When** I specify conditions, 
  **Then** I should be able to create logical expressions that use the selected fields.
- **Given** I have added a formula with multiple operators and fields,
  **When** I click 'Save',
  **Then** the new value should be stored and be available for selection in the analysis prompt input.
- **Given** I have created a new value by combining fields,
  **When** I try to save the formula with invalid syntax,
  **Then** the system should display an error message indicating the specific issue with the expression.

These two user stories should capture the necessary functionality for both adding fields from Optimist into the prompt and creating custom values using logical and mathematical operators. If you'd like to refine the user stories further or need any specific adjustments, feel free to ask!
